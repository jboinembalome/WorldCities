      Being passionate about programming, I wanted to deepen my knowledge in full-stack web development. For this, I
      bought the excellent book <strong>ASP.NET Core 5 and Angular - Fourth Edition</strong> by <strong>Valerio De
        Sanctis</strong> which covers the
      following elements :

      This book is very formative for developers who want to learn about ASP.NET Core 5 and Angular and is a good
      starting point if you want to learn these technologies. If you are interested, don't hesitate to buy it ðŸ˜‰<br>
      After reading this book, I wanted to take the context of the World Cities project used in this book to create an
      ASP.NET Core 5 - Angular application with Tailwind and Clean Architecture.
